# Custom README Generator
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

This project uses Inquirer NPM and Node.js to run a JS script that gives the user a series of prompts about how they would like their README file to look and what to include. The script then generates a professional-quality README.md file from the responses at the index level of the project directory.
