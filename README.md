# Unit-9-Challenge
## Homework challenge for Unit 9: NodeJS

## Having read the instructions, I have, to the best of my abilities, done the following:

- used Inquirer NPM and NodeJS to create a custom README generator that runs in the console and outputs a .md file that can be used as a professional quality Github Repo README
- added screenshots and links to this readme for the deployed application repo
- pushed my files to GitHub and deployed them to a live site through GitHub
- submitted the deployed application URL and GitHub repo to BCS for review and grading

[URL of Deployed Application](TBD)

![screen recording of functional deployed site](TBD)
